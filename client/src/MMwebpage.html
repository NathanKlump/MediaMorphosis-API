        <h1>MediaMorphosis-API</h1>

        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>MediaMorphosis API, written in Rust, leverages FFmpeg for high-performance media conversion. It effortlessly
            transforms audio, video, and images into various formats, ensuring quality and speed. Ideal for developers
            needing a reliable, swift media converter.</p>

        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>FFMPEG is a linux command line utility that can converts media formats into others. Our server is
            created in order to
            receive an input stream of a media file and a desired file type, feed it into the server and convert the
            file. Then, it is outputted
            as a file that contains a stream of data back to the client. We created this server using the programming
            language Rust and the front end was done with react. Here is the webpage link:
            <a href="source_link">
                https://media-morphosis-api.vercel.app/</a>
        </p>

        <h2>Implementation</h2>
        <p>Our website can be used for media conversion for many use cases. An example of one is converting a video
            format for mobile device compatibility for video formats that might not be supprted. Another example is
            content creation for multimedia hobbyists.</p>

        <h2>Setup Details</h2>
        <p>To get MediaMorphosis-API up and running on a VM, Rust programming language and FFmpeg have to be installed.
            Then, clone the project repository and adjust some parts of the configuration files. Specifically, the
            input/output directories and server ports. Next, configure the React server to connect with the API server.
            To execute, the user can use the 'start_MM_service.sh script'. The user can also configure the automated log
            backups as they want.</p>

        <h3>Project Name</h3>
        <p>MediaMorphosis API</p>

        <h3>Group Ownerships</h3>
        <p>Two user groups were created within the GCP VM: 'Admin' and 'Peasants'. The 'Admin' group
            has access to logs and system activities, while 'Peasants' are restricted from accessing logs to maintain
            data integrity.</p>

        <h3>Restricted Resources</h3>
        <p>The restricted resource was associated with the video size, and the success rate of the logging has been a
            bit of an
            issue due
            to the middleware. The middleware reads the header bits, which might have a chance of failing, although that
            hasn't
            happened yet.</p>

        <h3>WRITE WHERE TO FIND IT: Script Details</h3>
        <p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                &#x2022 log_network_traffic.sh: Automation of network trafficinf and bandwith usage of the API.
            </li>
            <li>&#x2022 log_ststem_resources.sh: Automation of system resource tracking (ex: CPU and Memory)</li>
            <li>&#x2022 log_ststem_resources.sh:
                This script automates the start of the Rust application and also contains a redirection for the output
                of to a log file.</li>
        </ul>
        </p>

        <h3>WRITE WHERE TO FIND IT: Logging Specifics</h3>
        <p>Two logging scripts are used:
        <ul>
            <li>
                &#x2022 log_network_traffic.sh:
                A script that is employed to log the network traffic hitting the API, facilitating both troubleshooting
                network performance
                issues and also tracking the utilization of the network bandwidth over time.
            </li>
            <li>&#x2022 log_ststem_resources.sh:
                This script is very helpful with trying to figure out why the system isn't performing well. Plus, it's
                always
                tracking how our
                system resources are used over time, giving us some really useful insights into their patterns and how
                they fluctuate in
                performance.</li>
        </ul>
        </p>

        <h3>Backup Script</h3>
        <p>The backup script we created allows for backup file to be created every 24 hours at 2 am. The file is then
            archived and zipped. It is located in the following pwd: /home/server/local/CSI3660ProjectBackup. Note:
            'CSI3660ProjectBackup' is a directory.
        </p>

        <h2>Group Members and Contributions</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Nathaniel Klump: Rust server dev, created react axios call, added logging processes, created backup
                system.
            </li>
            <li>John Ataalla: Helped build rust server, and hosting the service to the public. Tested sending requests
                and
                retrieving data.
                Added control access for sensitive files on the server.
            </li>
            <li>Dominick Kalaj: Frontend development, changed from SvelteKit to React, access form and file submission.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Service Screenshot</h2>
        <p>
            <img src=https://i.ibb.co/xJyhkM8/form.png" alt="Service Screenshot">
        <p>User will click on 'Choose File'. The file explorer will open and the user is to look for a media file.</p>
        <img src=https://i.ibb.co/s18xCym/mmimage2.png" alt="Service Screenshot">
        <p>The user select a media file and press open.</p>
        <img src=https://i.ibb.co/J2b4w1t/mmimage3.png" alt="Service Screenshot">
        <p>The user will put the new name with the file format they desire. The new file will show up in the downloads
            folder.</p>

        </p>

        <h2>Results and Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Our MediaMorphosis-API effecitively demonstrates media conversion with the successful integration of Rust,
            React and FFmpeg technologies while using the GCP VM Linux system for scripting and backup mechanics. Future
            works would contain enhancing UI.</p>
